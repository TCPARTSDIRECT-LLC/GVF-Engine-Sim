## Abstract
Recent mechanistic interpretability research demonstrates that large-scale AI models construct latent "Global Workspaces" (J-Spaces) in middle layers to execute multi-step reasoning. However, static-token architectures lack a physical temporal clock, requiring massive energy overhead to maintain coherent working memory across time. The Gated Vector Field (GVF) Engine solves this by applying a dynamic, phase-locked alternating current (AC) carrier wave across Spiking Neural Network (SNN) membrane arrays. Functioning as an algorithmic metronome, GVF regularizes dynamic neural firing, prunes redundant math at the memory bitline via Integrated Clock Gating (ICG), and stabilizes latent reasoning spaces at milliwatt power scales.

## 1. The Workspace Coherence Bottleneck
When deep neural networks execute complex reasoning, middle-layer feed-forward networks (FFNs) must maintain state across sequential evaluations. In standard Transformer architectures, this workspace operates without a temporal rhythm, forcing the system to re-evaluate dense matrix multiplications indiscriminately.

Without a global timing signal, latent representations are vulnerable to noise accumulation and rapid memory decay. To compensate, modern systems rely on energy-intensive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) token generation. The GVF architecture replaces this brute-force approach by imposing a continuous, time-dependent threshold envelope directly onto the membrane potential equation:

V_th(t) = V_base + A * sin(2*pi*f*t + phi)

This continuous wave acts as a structural clock, coaxing distributed activation vectors into synchronized, temporal firing windows.

## 2. Empirical Validation of Workspace Regularization
To evaluate whether a global carrier wave stabilizes latent network states, the GVF framework was benchmarked on neuromorphic event streams (Tonic N-MNIST) over 300 simulation time-steps:

| Network Configuration | Carrier Wave Parameters | Test Accuracy | Mathematical Loss | Compute Dynamic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flatline Control (Config C)** | Amplitude = 0.0V, Freq = 0.0 Hz | 96.16% | High / Unregularized | Uncoordinated firing; static DC baseline |
| **GVF Dynamic Sync (Config B)** | Amplitude = 0.4V, Freq = 50.0 Hz | **96.53%** | **Optimized / Minimized** | **Phase-locked firing; sparse temporal windows** |

Removing the global wave degraded task precision. Reintroducing the 50 Hz dynamic threshold yielded a **+0.37% accuracy increase** while lowering total network loss. The global wave mathematically enforces temporal discipline across the network, preserving information integrity without expanding parameter counts.

## 3. Ultra-Low-Power Reasoning at the Edge
Traditional AI reasoning models draw hundreds of watts because every token evaluation triggers full Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) cycles. GVF shifts evaluation logic directly into Compute-In-Memory (CIM) bitline arrays. 

When activation energy fails to clear the moving V_th(t) envelope, local Integrated Clock Gating (ICG) cells freeze downstream ALU clock trees in under 0.01 ms. This allows edge devices (neuromorphic chips, mobile NPUs, and industrial sensors) to sustain active working memory locally without relying on cloud data centers.

## 4. Environmental Harmonic Alignment
Standard AI models treat input data as static, disconnected token arrays. GVF introduces **Harmonic Alignment**—the structural synchronization of the network's internal carrier frequency (f) with the physical rhythm of its operating environment.

* **Power Grid Infrastructure:** Locking f to a 60 Hz fundamental wave enables instant detection of transient micro-arcing faults against baseline noise.
* **Biomedical Monitoring:** Phase-locking f to a 1 Hz cardiovascular rhythm isolates complex physiological anomalies in real time.
* **High-Speed Robotics:** Scaling f to megahertz frequencies coordinates high-speed motor telemetry under strict latency constraints.

By aligning internal threshold oscillations with external physical cadences, GVF-driven systems maximize signal-to-noise ratio while minimizing total dynamic compute.

## 5. Architectural Deployment & Portability
Hardware abstraction testing confirms that the GVF carrier wave maps directly onto standard leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) membrane arrays via generic PyNN interfaces. The system requires no custom lower-level drivers, making it immediately portable to physical neuromorphic substrates including SpiNNaker, BrainScaleS-2, and Intel Loihi 2.
