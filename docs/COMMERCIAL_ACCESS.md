# GVF Engine™: Commercial Access & Licensing Policy

**Copyright (c) 2026 GVF Dynamics, LLC. All rights reserved.**  
**Sole Inventor:** Antonio Gonzalez  
**Patent Status:** Intellectual Property Pending / Patent Reservation Active  

This document defines the official access tiers, usage rights, and commercial boundaries for the **GVF Engine™** (Phase-Locked AC Dynamic Thresholding, Bitline-Level SRAM Gating, and Clock-Tree Suppression Architecture) and its associated orchestration software.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview: Software vs. Silicon IP

The GVF technology ecosystem is strictly separated into two distinct layers:
1. **The Software Emulation & Orchestrator Toolchain:** PyTorch / snnTorch simulation environments, benchmark scripts, and automated execution harnesses.
2. **The Hardware Intellectual Property (RTL):** Synthesizable SystemVerilog models, analog/digital threshold generator top-level schematics, bitline comparator specs, and clock-tree freeze circuit descriptions.

## 🔍 Tier Details

### Tier 1: Public / Open Source (GPLv3)
* **Purpose:** Academic research, community validation, and open emulation.
* **Included:** PyTorch/snnTorch algorithmic simulation models (`src/`), basic benchmark evaluation scripts, public documentation, and disclaimers.
* **Limitations:** Code is governed by GNU GPLv3. All quantitative metrics derived from this tier represent software simulation outcomes only (no silicon or FPGA validation). Does **not** convey rights to synthesizable hardware descriptions or commercial silicon fabrication.

### Tier 2: Commercial Developer Access (Polar.sh)
* **Purpose:** Internal commercial evaluation, automated benchmarking, and advanced parameter sweeps.
* **Included:** Full source access to the multi-agent orchestrator harness, automated telemetry rendering (16:9 & 9:16 assets), dynamic thresholding ($V_{\text{th}}(t)$) parameter sweep tools, and commercial evaluation rights.
* **Access Link:** [Purchase Commercial Developer Access on Polar.sh](https://polar.sh/checkout/polar_c_ifALsQATNmgCRfyPPhyLXThLudm4wnewFTX4I0QMeeR)
* **Limitations:** Grants commercial software usage rights for the orchestrator and SDK only. **Does not include SystemVerilog RTL, netlists, or hardware manufacturing rights.**

### Tier 3: Enterprise Soft IP (RTL & Silicon Licensing)
* **Purpose:** FPGA mapping, ASIC integration, and SoC hardware design.
* **Included:** Synthesizable SystemVerilog modules ($V_{\text{th}}(t)$ AC envelope generator, bitline-level SRAM gating interfaces, and downstream clock-tree freeze logic), timing constraints, verification testbenches, and direct engineering support.
* **Process:** Executed via a formal **Technical Evaluation Agreement (TEA)** and Bilateral Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
